# Welcome to the EMDA Game Development Templates (GPD).

This is a tool to facilitate the creation of simple top-down or side-scrolling games.  We've encapsulated a number of useful functions and structures, to allow you to focus on designing your game experience rather than reinventing how to get a character to move on screen.

This template is useful for a variety of top-down games - mazes, rogue-like, etc.  You can define object / character types and place them using a simple grid.  Demonstrates levels, sounds, score, collision, preloading assets, and more!
